# Sketches for Inner Product Estimation (Coming soon)

This repository provides implementations of sketching algorithms for inner product estimation used in the paper ["Weighted Minwise Hashing Beats Linear Sketching for Inner Product Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05811), which introduces an approach for inner product estimation using minwise hashing sketches. The code is meant for research and has not been optimized in any way.

**Note: The code has not been released yet. It will be available soon.**
